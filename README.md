This is the first project of the Spring 2014 CS 188 (introduction to Artificial Intelligence) class at UC Berkeley. It implements different search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS and AStar). Pacman does not work against adversarial agents (ghosts) but can clean up a board highly efficiently with AStar search and the foodHeuristic (implemented in searchAgents.py).
